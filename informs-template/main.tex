\ABSTRACT{
% big background
Stochastic control in multi-class queueing networks has been extensively studied primarily focusing on minimizing operational costs (e.g., waiting, abandonment).
% what is novel
However, in many real-world applications, the system operator must balance the trade-off between waiting costs and maximizing immediate rewards when assigning customers to service units.
